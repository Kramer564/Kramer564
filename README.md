- 👋 Hi, I’m Ayush.
- 👀 I have worked as a Java Developer since the last 5 years and also had a few attempts at frontend using Angular.
- 🌱 Getting more ahnds on with frontend thats my goal for the year. Learning in depth about how the frameworks works under the hood. In the end design quality coded scalable applications.
- 💞️ I will be creating random projects which I do at my own time to understand how things actually work in the world of development.
